        Thank you for using LED Caller ID. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        LED Caller ID displays caller id information from the <a href="http://opencnam.com/">opencnam</a> database when you receive a phone call.
        To use it, all you need to do is ensure that the button below reads "Caller ID is ON." If you wish to
        disable it at any time, just press the button to toggle it off. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As with any phone, sometimes caller id information is not available. When this happens, a message is displayed
        to inform you that no information was found. Due to the nature of the telephone system and opencnam database, 
        you will find that this application has more information about land lines than mobiles.
